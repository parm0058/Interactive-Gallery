## Interactive Gallery
In my Gallery,I make a folder of my gallery. In my folder, I add index.html file,main.css and main.js files.
Then I add basic syntax into my index.html file and then I link my css and java script files to my index.html file.


## Design 

  First,I start to work with my javascript.I made an empty array of my images.That array should contain my all the images.Then I add my all elements using the id of elements.Then I add my event in my javascript  like mouseover,mousevent and click event.
  
  - In my mouseover and mouseevent,I target my img tag and then I also add style like   filter,backgroundBlendMode
   and transform tags.
> In my click event for images:
1) style tag  ```display```
2) Image ```src```  tag
3) ```textcontent``` for images
> In my click event for close button:
1) style tag ```display```

# Animation

  
  - For animation tag I used the animation.css file and I link my file to the html file and then I go and check the online animation on animation.css. For my all, images I used to the animation like slow and slidindown and slidinup.






# Responsive

> Define Responsive steps

* In my css,I used
* ```display:grid```
* ```grid-template-columns```
* ```grid-gap```
* ```margin``` to make it responsive.
 




# Challenges

1) It is very hard for me to get done resize of photos.because I am not to much know about the photoshop. So, I Spand my two hours on my images.
2) The next one is like it is very easy for using disply grid but I had problem with it to make it responsive.Because my content is not going in to the center.but finally its working 
3) The onther one is like,I want to use the transform but it will be override by my animation.css fileand it should not working so i dropped this idea.
4) Final one is like,I made a syntax mistake so I got errors in my click event.Because I want to add the close button.but finally is working.
